I created fully functional Quiz App developed using Flutter & Dart. 💻📱
Through this project, I explored:
☑️ Managing questions dynamically using List<Map>
☑️ Implementing state management with setState()
☑️ Building a responsive and interactive UI using widgets like Scaffold, Column, ElevatedButton
☑️ Conditional styling for right/wrong answers
☑️ Navigation through Next buttons & a Result Screen with a scorecard and reset option.
This project gave me hands-on experience in understanding the basic app flow from Start Screen → Questions → Result Screen.
